# Notes

## Private off-chain storage

For scalability and performance reasons, storing IoT data off-chain should be the best choice.

Hyperledger Fabric, and similar blockchains which are not IoT scoped, could find some troubles handling high-frequency data from IoT sensors.

This could be a point to discuss into the evaluation/measures paragraph.
